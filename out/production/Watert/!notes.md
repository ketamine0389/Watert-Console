- Working on setting up `Entity` and subsequent subclasses
######5/21/2022
- Fixing up player movement
- Added `getPlayerStats()` method in `Board`
######5/22/2022
- Polishing player movement
- Added player visibility
######5/23/2022
- Begun work on Combat system




# Issues
- `rand()` inside of `Board.java` should be modified
    - Look into `Random.nextInt()`
- possibly too little monsters in each difficulty
- Entity - human/monster/player conversion is gonna be really whack and require some redundant code
- `movePlayer()` method inside of `Board` should begin combat upon cell being occupied
- `movePlayer()` method kinda whack
- some stuff inside of `getBoardAsString()` could be simplified
